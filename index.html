        2024-2025 FTC Season - Into the Deep
      </h2>
      <h3 class="normtext" style="line-height: 1">
        We are participating in the First Tech Challenge: Into the Deep,
        presented by RTX. Though sadly there is no water involved, the game
        objective is to explore the "deep sea" field with our "submersible"
        robot, collecting samples in the form of red, yellow, and blue boxes.
        FIRST hopes to uncover the potential in each of us to strengthen our
        community and innovate for a better world with healthy oceans.

      <h4 class="header" style="line-height: 0.1">Outreach</h4>
      <h4 class="normtext" style="line-height: 1">
        During the summers, we host a six week summer camp along with Team 254
        where upcoming freshmen build robots with VEX parts and compete in a
        livestreamed competition at the end. In September, we hosted an outreach
        event at The Tech Museum. Our goal was to introduce robotics to children
        and inspire them to compete in their own team in the future. We plan to
        have a table for the Computer History Museum's Techfest on December 7th.
        In addition, Joyce-Ellington library, and hopefully other libraries in
        the future, have accepted our inviitation to host a weekly workshop,
        tying in to the Silicon Valley Reads theme for 2025: Empowering Humanity
        Through Technology.

      <h4 class="header" style="line-height: 0.1">Our Sponsors</h4>
      <h6 class="normtext" style="line-height: 1">
        We'd like to thank our sponsors for helping contribute to our success.
        Without their support, we would never be able to get this far. Special
        thanks to Swyft for their financial help and donation of their new Swyft
        wheels for improved movement, crucial to the game.
